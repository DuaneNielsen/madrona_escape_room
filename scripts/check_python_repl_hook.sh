# Claude Code SessionStart Hook: Check Python REPL MCP Server
#
# This hook runs when a Claude Code session starts and checks if the
# python-repl MCP server is configured. It only prints a warning if
# the server is missing.
#
# Part of: Madrona Escape Room Development Tools
# See: docs/development/tools/PYTHON_REPL_MCP_SETUP.md

# Only warn if python-repl is NOT configured
