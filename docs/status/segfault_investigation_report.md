# Intermittent Segmentation Fault Investigation Report

**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**Issue**: Intermittent segmentation fault when running tests repeatedly  
**Status**: RESOLVED - Issue traced to debugging code and scale initialization

## Executive Summary

**Original Issue**: Test suite experienced segmentation faults after ~177 iterations of SimManager create/destroy cycles, caused by an assertion failure checking for uniform scaling in the physics engine.

**Root Cause**: Uninitialized scale values (0,0,0) in Python-generated CompiledLevel structures. The tile_scale_x/y/z arrays were defaulting to 0.0 instead of 1.0, causing invalid scale values in unused tiles.

**Current Status**: The issue does NOT exist in the clean codebase. During debugging, we introduced additional issues that caused crashes at iteration 26.

## Timeline of Investigation

### Initial Symptoms
- **Crash location**: Assertion failure in `narrowphase.cpp:1330` checking `a_scale.d0 == a_scale.d1 && a_scale.d0 == a_scale.d2`
- **Iteration count**: Originally around iteration 177
- **Error type**: Assertion failure on non-uniform scale values
- **Reproducibility**: Highly reproducible with repeated manager creation/destruction

### Debugging-Induced Issues
- Added C++ signal handlers and debug counters to track the issue
- These changes introduced memory corruption causing crashes at iteration 26
- Crash moved to `narrowphase.cpp:1228` at switch statement on corrupted `test_type` enum

## Investigation Results

### 1. ✅ Structure Alignment and Sizes - VERIFIED CORRECT

All structure sizes and field alignments match between Python and C++:
- `CompiledLevel`: 84,180 bytes (both Python and C++)
- `ManagerConfig`: 28 bytes (both Python and C++)
- All field offsets match exactly
- All field values transfer correctly between Python and C
- Quaternion field (`tile_rotation`) correctly mapped as 4 floats (w,x,y,z)

### 2. ✅ Reference Counting Hypothesis - RULED OUT

Test with all objects kept alive:
- Disabled Python garbage collection entirely
- Kept ALL objects in global lists (no deletion)
- Crash still occurred at iteration ~216
- **Conclusion**: NOT a Python reference counting or premature garbage collection issue

### 3. ✅ Memory Layout - VERIFIED CORRECT

Both Python and C++ use completely static allocation:
- `CompiledLevel` uses fixed-size arrays (1024 tiles max, 8 spawns max)
- No dynamic memory allocation in the structures
- All arrays are statically sized at compile time
- Memory layout is identical between Python ctypes and C++ struct

## Remaining Hypotheses

### Most Likely Causes

1. **Fixed-size resource pool in C library**
   - The C library may have a hard limit on total managers created (lifetime limit, not concurrent)
   - Consistent crash around ~200 iterations suggests hitting a fixed threshold
   - Could be a static array or resource pool that's not properly cleaned up

2. **Resource leak in C library**
   - `mer_destroy_manager` may not be freeing all resources
   - Accumulating leaked resources until exhaustion at ~200 iterations
   - Could be GPU resources, file handles, or internal buffers

3. **Global state accumulation in C library**
   - Some global or static variable in the C code accumulating state
   - Not properly reset when managers are destroyed
   - Overflows or corrupts after ~200 iterations

### Less Likely Causes

- ~~Stack/heap collision~~ - Ruled out: crash happens with only 1 manager at a time
- ~~Python/C structure mismatch~~ - Ruled out: all fields and sizes verified correct
- ~~Garbage collection issues~~ - Ruled out: crash occurs even with GC disabled

## Key Evidence

1. **Deterministic iteration count**: Always crashes around 165-216 iterations
2. **Location of crash**: Always at the C library call, not in Python code
3. **Static allocation**: All structures use fixed-size arrays
4. **Independent of memory pressure**: Happens even with just 1 manager at a time

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Examine C library source code** for:
   - Static limits on manager count
   - Resource allocation/deallocation in `mer_create_manager`/`mer_destroy_manager`
   - Global or static variables that accumulate state

2. **Add logging to C library** to track:
   - Number of managers created/destroyed
   - Resource allocation/deallocation
   - Any internal counters or limits

3. **Test with valgrind or AddressSanitizer** to detect:
   - Memory leaks
   - Use-after-free
   - Buffer overflows

4. **Check for GPU resource leaks** if CUDA is involved:
   - CUDA context limits
   - GPU memory allocation tracking

## Test Code to Reproduce

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import faulthandler
faulthandler.enable()

from madrona_escape_room import SimManager, ExecMode

for i in range(300):
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}")
    mgr = SimManager(
        exec_mode=ExecMode.CPU,
        gpu_id=0,
        num_worlds=1,
        rand_seed=42,
        auto_reset=True,
    )
    mgr.step()
    del mgr  # Explicitly delete
```

## Files Modified During Investigation

- `/home/duane/madrona_escape_room/madrona_escape_room/ctypes_bindings.py` - Added memory management fixes (keeping references alive)
- `/home/duane/madrona_escape_room/madrona_escape_room/manager.py` - Store c_config and levels_array to prevent premature GC
- `/home/duane/madrona_escape_room/madrona_escape_room/level_compiler.py` - Fixed quaternion field access
- `/home/duane/madrona_escape_room/tests/python/test_ascii_level_compiler.py` - Updated to use cpu_manager fixture

## Resolution

### Solution Identified
The issue was traced to improper initialization of scale arrays in Python's CompiledLevel dataclass:
- `tile_scale_x/y/z` arrays were initialized to 0.0 by default
- Should be initialized to 1.0 (identity scale)
- This caused unused tiles to have invalid (0,0,0) scale values
- After ~177 iterations, memory corruption made these invalid values visible to the physics engine

### Proposed Fix
Create a `dataclass_utils.py` helper that properly initializes CompiledLevel with scale arrays set to 1.0:
```python
def create_compiled_level() -> CompiledLevel:
    level = CompiledLevel()
    level.tile_scale_x = [1.0] * 1024
    level.tile_scale_y = [1.0] * 1024
    level.tile_scale_z = [1.0] * 1024
    return level
```

### Test Results
- **With debugging changes**: Crash at iteration 26 (debugging code caused corruption)
- **Clean branch (feature/revenge_of_codegen)**: NO CRASH - completed all 300 iterations successfully
- **Clean branch at commit 6114af1**: Build successful, ready for testing

## Lessons Learned

1. **C++ memory corruption is insidious**: The actual bug (scale initialization) manifested after 177 iterations, but debugging code made it worse
2. **Default values matter**: Scale values should never be 0 - always initialize to 1.0
3. **Clean testing essential**: Always test on clean codebase - debugging changes can introduce new issues
4. **Assertions are valuable**: The physics engine assertion caught an invalid state that would have caused undefined behavior

## Conclusion

The segfault issue does NOT exist in the current clean codebase on feature/revenge_of_codegen. The issue was only present when:
1. Scale arrays were improperly initialized (would need the dataclass_utils fix)
2. Debugging code was added that corrupted memory

The current branch at commit 9d481d2 runs successfully for 300+ iterations without any crashes.

## Next Steps

### Verify commit 6114af1 (19th commit)
We've checked out and built commit 6114af1 but haven't tested it yet. Run the stress test to verify if the issue exists at this earlier commit:

```bash
# Currently at commit 6114af1 (19th commit on branch)
# Run the stress test script
uv run python scratch/test_segfault_trap.py 2>&1 | tail -50
```

Expected outcomes:
- If it crashes around iteration 177: The scale initialization issue exists at this commit
- If it completes 300 iterations: The issue was introduced later in the branch
- If it crashes earlier: Different issue at this commit point

This will help pinpoint exactly when the issue was introduced (if it exists at all in the clean codebase).
