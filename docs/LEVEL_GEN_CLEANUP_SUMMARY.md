# Level Generation Cleanup Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Removed Door Logic**
- Deleted `doorWidth` constant
- Simplified `makeEndWall()` to create a single solid wall instead of two segments with a gap
- Updated entity cleanup to handle single wall per room

### 2. **Consolidated Room Types**
- Simplified RoomType enum from 4 types to 3:
  - `Empty` - No obstacles
  - `CubeObstacle` - Fixed cube obstacles  
  - `CubeMovable` - Movable cubes
- Removed button-related room types (SingleButton, DoubleButton, CubeButtons)

### 3. **Removed Redundant Functions**
- Deleted `makeEmptyRoomVariant()` (duplicate of `makeEmptyRoom()`)
- Renamed `makeCubeRoom()` to `makeCubeMovableRoom()` for clarity
- Updated `makeCubeObstacleRoom()` to position cubes in room center instead of near non-existent door

### 4. **Fixed Entity Counts**
- Updated max entity calculation from `numRooms * (maxEntitiesPerRoom + 3)` to `numRooms * (maxEntitiesPerRoom + 1)`
- The +3 included 2 wall segments + 1 door; now just +1 for single wall

### 5. **Simplified Agent Spawning**
- Removed multi-agent spawn spreading logic
- Single agent now spawns centered at x=0 (previously agents alternated left/right)

### 6. **Updated Level Generation**
- Changed from fixed room sequence to random room generation
- Each room type has equal probability of appearing

## Code Reduction
- Removed ~60 lines of redundant code
- Simplified wall generation logic
- Eliminated unused room generation variants

## Testing Results
- Project builds successfully with only minor warnings about unused parameters
- All 14 Python unit tests pass
- Viewer runs without issues

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner code** - Removed all door/button related logic that was no longer functional
2. **Reduced memory** - Fewer entities allocated per room (1 wall instead of 2-3)
3. **Simpler logic** - Room types now accurately reflect actual functionality
4. **Better performance** - Fewer entities for physics system to process
