# Camera System Status Report

## Current State

### What's Working
1. **Camera Controller Architecture** - Successfully created modular camera controller system with base interface and three implementations (FreeFly, Tracking, Fixed)
2. **Camera Mode Switching** - Can cycle between camera modes using 'C' key
3. **Tracking Target Updates** - Tracking camera correctly receives agent position updates and calculates forward vector to look at agent
4. **Initial Camera Positioning** - Camera initially positions itself relative to agent spawn location

### ✅ Fixed Issues

#### Issue 1: WASD Input Interference [FIXED]
**Problem**: WASD keys affected our custom camera system even when user was in Agent camera mode (controlIdx > 0)
**Solution**: Used `viewer.getCurrentControlID()` method to properly detect camera mode
**Implementation**: Check `controlID == 0` for free camera mode, only process WASD input when in free mode
**Status**: FIXED - WASD now only affects camera when in free camera mode

### Known Issues

#### Issue 2: Tracking Camera Position Drift
**Problem**: Tracking camera position moves incorrectly relative to the agent
**Observed Behavior**: 
- Camera position drifts away from agent instead of maintaining fixed offset
- Example: Camera at `pos(-5.72,-7.84,15.00)` when agent at `(0.19,0.16,0.00)`
**Debug Output Shows**:
- Target position is correct: `target(0.49,0.09,0.00)`
- Forward vector is correct: `fwd(0.00,0.55,-0.83)` (pointing at agent)
- But camera position updates incorrectly when WASD is pressed

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/camera_controller.hpp/cpp` - Camera controller system implementation
- `src/viewer.cpp` - Integration of camera controllers into viewer
- `external/madrona/src/viz/viewer.cpp` - Disabled handleCamera(), added camera access methods
- `external/madrona/include/madrona/viz/viewer.hpp` - Added camera control interface
- `src/mgr.hpp/cpp` - Added getAgentPosition() method

### Architecture
The system has two parallel camera systems:
1. **Madrona's built-in camera system** - Accessed through menu, handles agent cameras
2. **Our custom camera controller system** - Accessed with 'C' key, provides FreeFly/Tracking/Fixed modes

## Next Steps Required

### ✅ Fix 1: Proper Control State Detection [COMPLETED]
**Solution Implemented**: Used existing `viewer.getCurrentControlID()` method to detect camera mode
- When `controlID == 0`: Free camera mode (our camera system active)
- When `controlID > 0`: Agent camera mode (our camera system disabled)
**Result**: WASD input no longer interferes when viewing through agent cameras

### Fix 2: Fix Tracking Camera Position Logic
The tracking camera's `updateCameraPosition()` method needs revision:
- Currently using smoothing factor that may be causing drift
- WASD input is being applied even in tracking mode
- Need to separate camera offset control from position tracking

### Fix 3: Clean Integration
- Remove debug printf statements after fixes are verified
- Properly handle the case where agent position might not be available
- Add world switching support (currently hardcoded to world 0)

## Recommendation
The core architecture is sound. Completed fixes:
1. ✅ Proper detection of camera mode using `getCurrentControlID()`

Remaining work:
1. Fix the tracking camera's position update logic to maintain proper offset
2. Consider fully replacing the Madrona camera system instead of running two in parallel for better integration
